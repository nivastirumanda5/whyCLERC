  <h1 style="color:Tomato;" > Why You Should Donate: </h1>
  <p>Glasses are crucial for poorer countries due to their significant impact on education, productivity, and overall quality of life. In these countries, access to vision correction is often limited, resulting in a higher prevalence of uncorrected refractive errors. By providing glasses, individuals can overcome visual impairments, enabling them to read, learn, and participate fully in educational activities.</p>
